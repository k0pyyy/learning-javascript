// This chapter is all about higher order functions. I am having some real trouble with this, so I am
// going to try and work through and maybe comment the code that is given in the book until I understand
// what is going on.

// FOR EACH
// this seems pretty simple, it's like a shorthand version of a "for each" loop
let data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];

data.forEach(i => {
    console.log(i ** 2);
});
